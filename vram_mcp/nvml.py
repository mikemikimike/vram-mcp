"""NVML-based VRAM/process telemetry via nvidia-ml-py.

Pure module: the real ``pynvml`` (nvidia-ml-py) is injected as the ``nvml``
parameter, defaulting to the real package, so tests never need a real GPU or
driver. Every function degrades to ``None``/``[]``/``{}`` on ANY failure —
not just ``NVMLError`` but also e.g. ``AttributeError`` from the legacy
``pynvml`` PyPI package shadowing nvidia-ml-py (missing ``nvmlMemory_v2`` /
``*RunningProcesses_v3``) — never raises to the caller.
